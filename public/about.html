<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Anthony and i am an aspiring Web Developer from the Philippines. i started my journey July 01, 2024
  and my goal is to master this field and to gain experience and enhance my knowledge. 
  I will keep on practicing my skill to get better at it one day. I am open to any kind of constructive critisism,
  advice and other input that will help me grow.</p>

<p>As i make this simple Web Page as part of my learning i included some small project that i have already made.
  i still have a long way to go but i know eventually i will get to where i want to be, im just enjoying the
  learning process and slowly injecting the information into my system.
</p>

<p>I am enjoying the process and the new path that i am taking right now and hopefully i get to find a great company
  that will hire me and train me so i can further enhance my skills a company that i will grow with and will challange
  and motivates me at the same time to push more further. i am so excited to finish the bootcamp i am now and start
  applying what i've learned together with my future first Company.
